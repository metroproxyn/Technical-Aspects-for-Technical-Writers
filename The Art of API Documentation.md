# The Art of API Documentation

This material assumes that you understand the basics of how APIs work: {JSON}, < XML/>, REST and how to document them.

## What are API?

- Applicaiton Programming Interface
- It defines how two pieces of software talk to each other
- Two most common types of APIs:
  - Web APIs (REST, SOAP, etc.)
  - PLatform APIs (Java, C++, etc.)

## API Documentation

- Software developer audience
- Good documentation
  - Increases developer edoption
  - Decreases support costs
- The developers who created the API are rarely the best people to document it =) Even if they write well, they are too close to the material

## Conceptual vs. Reference Material

API documentation can be divided into 2 parts:

- Conceptual
  - High level
  - Gets developer oriented
  - Gets developer started
  - Helps them with common tasks
- Reference
  - HTTP Requests and Responses
  - Classes, methods, properties, etc.

### Why is Conceptual Material Important?

- Developers need to read something that immediately communicates why they should spend time with an API
- Developers need to be able to get started easily, otherwise they will give up (?)
- Figuring out how to do common tasks can be difficult by just looking at the reference material

#### Writers are important

- Developers aren't great at reference material, but...
- Developers tend to be really bad at conceptual material
  - They naturally focus on "how" and forget "why"
  - They are too close to the API to see the big picture
  - Longer paragraphs tend to be harder for them

### Conceptual Material Consists of ...

Typically:
- Overview
- Getting Started
- Tutorials
- Sample Code

Each of these will be discussed in more details later.

#### Overview

- Explain why to use the API
- Requirements
- Key concepts (for example, for a Learning Management System, explain the roles of student, teacher or administrator)
- Workflow (meaning what is the order of steps taken to do common tasks)
- Architecture diagrams and/or data model

#### Getting Started



#### Tutorials



#### Sample Code
