# The Art of API Documentation

This material assumes that you understand the basics of how APIs work: {JSON}, < XML/>, REST and how to document them.

## What are API?

- Applicaiton Programming Interface
- It defines how two pieces of software talk to each other
- Two most common types of APIs:
  - Web APIs (REST, SOAP, etc.)
  - PLatform APIs (Java, C++, etc.)

## API Documentation

- Software developer audience
- Good documentation
  - Increases developer edoption
  - Decreases support costs
- The developers who created the API are rarely the best people to document it =) Even if they write well, they are too close to the material

## Conceptual vs. Reference Material

API documentation can be divided into 2 parts:

- Conceptual
  - High level
  - Gets developer oriented
  - Gets developer started
  - Helps them with common tasks
- Reference
  - HTTP Requests and Responses
  - Classes, methods, properties, etc.
