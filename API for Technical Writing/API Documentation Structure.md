This is a suggested structure, but is by no means the only way to structure the documentation. Many of

platform API.

- Overview (Why use the API? Provide use cases)
  - Getting Started
  - Key Concepts
  - Workflow
  - Architecture (primarily for platform APIs or complex web APIs)
  - Authentication (primarily for web APIs)
  - Tutorials
    - How to…
    - How to…
    - How to…
    - Sample Code
- Reference
  - Classes (for platform APIs)
  - Endpoints (for web APIs)
  - Status codes and errors (for web APIs)
