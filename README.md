# Technical Aspects for Technical Writers

Welcome! This repository is a curated collection of notes and guides on essential technical topics for Technical Writers, Documentation Engineers, and anyone looking to bridge the gap between writing and engineering.

I am applying "learning by teaching" method here. It will include material from learning courses I have completed, as well as my own notes on Technical Writing and AI. The goal is to provide a clear and concise knowledge base to help you level up your skills.
