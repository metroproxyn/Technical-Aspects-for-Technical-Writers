# Technical Aspects For Technical Writers

Knowledge hub for technical writers, documentations engineers and everyone who are interested in technologies!

I am applying "learning by teaching" method here.

This will be a pool of information on topics such as APIs, Cloud Computing, AI, Coding, and more, which are currently relevant for the Technical Writer role. It will include material from learning courses I have completed, as well as my own notes on Technical Writing and AI.
