# Docs-as-Code

In the fast-paced world of software development, documentation often gets treated as an afterthought. But what if we approached documentation with the same rigor and tools we use for code? That's what "Docs-as-Code" is for. It is a methodology, that is revolutionizing how teams create, maintain, and collaborate on technical docs. In this material, we will dive deep into the following subjects:

- What Docs-as-Code is,
- The tools you will need,
- The workflow it enables,
- How to automate quality checks, 

After that, we will take a balanced look at its advantages and drawbacks. Whether you are a technical writer, project manager or even a developer, this approach can streamline your processes and elevate your documentation approach.

## What is Docs-as-Code?

Docs-as-Code treats documentation the same way teams treat source code. In practice, this means using familiar engineering workflows for docs: version control, pull requests, reviews, automated checks, and CI pipelines. Documentation lives next to the codebase and evolves together with it, instead of being an afterthought updated once in a while.

This approach grew out of the open-source world. Projects like Linux or Kubernetes have always maintained large documentation repositories alongside their code, because there was no other way to keep them accurate at scale. Over time, enterprises started adopting the same model, simply because it works.

The core idea is straightforward: use the tools developers already rely on every day.

- Git for version control. 
- IDE / code editor for writing and editing. 
- Pipelines for building and publishing. 

As a result, documentation becomes a shared responsibility. Developers are comfortable reviewing docs in pull requests, and non-technical contributors can learn the workflow without needing a separate toolchain.
