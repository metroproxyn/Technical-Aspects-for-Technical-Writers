# CI/CD: Automating Your Workflow Like a Pro

CI/CD is one of those terms you hear everywhere in software teams, usually wrapped in a lot of technical jargon. For writers, technical communicators, or even hobbyist bloggers working with Docs-as-Code, it can sound like something meant “for developers only.”

In reality, CI/CD is simply the automation layer that takes your content from draft to published without manual steps, forgotten checks, or last-minute fixes. Once you understand how it works, it changes how you think about shipping documentation.

In this article, I will walk you through 

- What CI/CD actually is
- Why it matters even if you don’t write code
- How a typical pipeline is structured
- What happens when things break
- Which tools are worth starting with

Whether you’re deploying an application or publishing docs, CI/CD helps make the process faster, safer, and far more predictable.

## What Is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (or Continuous Deployment). At its core, it’s a set of practices that automate how changes are checked, built, and released. While it originated in software development, the same ideas apply perfectly to documentation and static websites built from text files. Instead of manually checking everything and deploying updates by hand, CI/CD lets a system do that work for you every time you make a change.
