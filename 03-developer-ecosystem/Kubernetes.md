# Introduction to Kubernetes

Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It originated from Google's internal container orchestration system and was open-sourced in 2014, combining years of production experience with community contributions. 

It is essential for technical writers know how to document cloud-native applications or DevOps processes and understanding Kubernetes processes, as it underpins much of modern software deployment.
