# Introduction to Kubernetes

Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It originated from Google's internal container orchestration system and was open-sourced in 2014, combining years of production experience with community contributions. 

It is essential for technical writers know how to document cloud-native applications or DevOps processes and understanding Kubernetes processes, as it underpins much of modern software deployment.

## What is Kubernetes?

At its core, Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool that manages groups of containers across multiple machines. Containers, like those created with Docker, package applications and their dependencies into portable units. Kubernetes takes this further by providing a framework to run these containers reliably in a distributed environment. It handles tasks such as scheduling containers onto machines, ensuring they stay running, and scaling them based on demand.

Because Kubernetes works across clouds and on-premises infrastructure, teams can use the same tooling and deployment practices in different environments. This makes it suitable not only for large organizations, but also for smaller teams managing growing applications.
