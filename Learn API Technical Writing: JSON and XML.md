SDK – Software Development Kit (what developer need to write API)


## Introduction

### API Overview

* API – Application Programming Interface
* It defines how two pieces of software talk to each other
* In this learning material, we are focusing on Web APIs

First Web API has been created by eBay

* APIs allow developers to create apps that "mash up" data from different sources
* Example: you want to create an app that show how to get to the nearest patk
  * The city provides an API that says where all the parks are
  * Google Maps provides and API that says how to get to a given location
  * Your app calls them both.
  
ProgrammableWeb showed the number of public API (deprecated).

What makes API documentation different than end user documentation?
* Youare writing for a developer audience
* The documentation is very text-based

### What is JSON and XML?

Two types of structured data
* Structured data doesn't fit into a table. It mostly looks like tree with all of the branches it has.

XML – older, still used

JSON – simpler, less text, more popular for new APIs
