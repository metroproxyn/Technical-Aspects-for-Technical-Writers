# Redoc

Redoc is a free, open-source tool for generating beautiful, interactive, and human-readable API documentation from an OpenAPI specification. Its primary goal is to make API documentation easy to read and navigate for end-users (developers).

It takes an OpenAPI definition file (in YAML or JSON format) and transforms it into a clean, three-panel static HTML page that includes a navigation menu, endpoint descriptions, and code examples.
